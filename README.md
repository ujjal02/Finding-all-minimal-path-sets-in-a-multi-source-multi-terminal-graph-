# Finding all minimal path sets of a graph having multi-source and multi-terminal
## -------------------- ##
#### In this project a new and efficient algorithm is presented to generate all minimal paths in graph G (V, E). The algorithm proposed builds the set of minimal paths gradually, starting from set of source nodes S. We present two versions of our algorithm: the first version determines all feasible paths in a directed graph and the second version determines all feasible paths in undirected graph. ####
